// usb_cdc_source.h — USB Host CDC-ACM driver for the Septentrio mosaic-go.
//
// Brings up the ESP32-P4 USB2.0 OTG in Host mode, opens the Mosaic's virtual
// COM (CDC-ACM) interface, and forwards every received byte into gnss_state
// (which feeds the SBF parser). The Mosaic exposes a COMPOSITE device (several
// CDC-ACM serial ports) — we sweep and bind the ONE CDC interface configured to
// stream SBF.

// NUL) into the reply alongside the ASCII response.
