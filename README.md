# tab5-caster

NTRIP caster firmware for **M5Stack Tab5 (ESP32-P4)**, fed by a **Septentrio
mosaic-go (mosaic-G5)** base receiver over **USB (CDC-ACM)**.

Sellable, flash-and-go RTK base box: Mosaic + Tab5 in one USB-C cable, no jumper
wiring. Runs a local NTRIP caster so rovers (auto-steer tractors, RTK drones)
keep getting corrections **even when the internet is down** — the offline-autonomy
reason the box exists. FKP / network-RTK synthesis is done in the **cloud**, not
on this box.

> **Status: gold-standard + turnkey verified on real hardware (2026-08).**
> A cold P4 boot self-resets the onboard C6, joins WiFi, auto-starts the caster,
> and a network NTRIP client pulls live multi-constellation RTCM3 (MSM7 + 1006/
> 1033/1230) straight from an attached Mosaic — no operator interaction, no
> external tools. Builds for `esp32p4` on ESP-IDF **5.4.4**.

## Why USB and not UART

UART (3.3V TTL, 3 wires) is the technically shortest path and needs almost no
firmware. USB was chosen anyway because a single USB-C cable is the right
**product** experience for a flash-and-go kit. The cost is this driver: the P4
must act as a USB **Host** and speak CDC-ACM to the Mosaic's composite device.

## Architecture

 C6 WiFi (ESP-Hosted/SDIO) ── rover pulls RTCM3 over the LAN
```

The **StreamBuffer seam** (`rtcm_sink`) decouples the USB byte source from the
caster: the USB driver's only contract is "push RTCM3 bytes." Because the monitor
and the caster would otherwise both read the same StreamBuffer (and race), a
single `rtcm_feed_task` is the **only** reader — it tees the bytes to the monitor
and to a second buffer the caster drains.

**Boot order matters (offline autonomy).** `app_main` brings up the USB→caster
core *before* WiFi, and WiFi runs on its own task. The C6 radio is a coprocessor
reached over SDIO; `esp_wifi_init()` blocks (retrying the ESP-Hosted transport)
if the C6 doesn't answer, so gating the caster behind it would let a WiFi-only
fault brick the box — exactly the opposite of the offline-autonomy promise.

## The three things that will bite (read before hacking)

1. **The RTCM COM is discovered, not fixed.** On the bench the Mosaic enumerates
   as **3 CDC-ACM COMs (itf 0/1, 2/3, 4/5) + a USB mass-storage interface (itf6)**
   — *no* ECM/RNDIS network interface. Which COM carries RTCM3 is a receiver-config
   choice (itf0 was silent, itf4 was an NMEA decoy, itf2 was RTCM3), so the driver
   **sweeps the three comm interfaces and latches the one whose bytes pass CRC-24Q**
   (NMEA is auto-skipped). The box also **self-provisions the RTCM3 output** on
   boot (see *Self-provisioning* below), so you no longer have to configure the
   Mosaic by hand — but note only **USB1 (itf2)** answers commands; the first COM
   (itf0) is silent both ways, so provisioning is attempted per-swept-interface
   until one acks.

   > ⚠ The specific layout above — **3 CDC COMs + MSC, itf0 silent both ways** —
   > is what *one* development unit enumerated as. It is **not** a mosaic-go
   > invariant: another individual/firmware (the P3H in `docs/hardware-findings.md`)
   > comes up as PID `0x8231` with only **two** CDC COMs (itf {0,2}), no
   > mass-storage interface, and itf0 *does* answer commands. Don't hard-code
   > these; the sweep exists precisely because the topology varies. Since a unit
   > can expose fewer interfaces than `MOSAIC_COM_ITFS` lists, the sweep now hops
   > off an un-openable itf after a few retries instead of retrying it forever.
2. **USB-A VBUS is gated by an I/O expander.** The 5V rail on the USB-A host port
   is switched by PI4IOE5V6408 #2 (I²C `0x44`, P3 = USB5V_EN, active-high) — see
   `board_power.c`. Without driving it the Mosaic is only trickle-powered and its
   D+ pull-up never rises, so it never enumerates. **Brownout is real:** the panel
   backlight shares this rail, and at full brightness a soft PC-USB supply + Mosaic
   streaming load sags it enough to drop the receiver off the bus (`CDC error`, no
   RTCM3). `backlight.c` mitigates this by holding brightness low until the stream
   is up and only climbing as far as the supply sustains (see M3-C) — but a stiff
   5V/2A source is still the right answer in the field.
3. **CDC-ACM host is callback-driven, not a POSIX fd** — hence the StreamBuffer
   instead of wrapping it as an `io.Stream` directly on the USB side.

## Self-provisioning the Mosaic (flash-and-go)

`mosaic_config.c` pushes the box's canonical RTCM3 base-station output config to
the receiver on every boot, so a Mosaic with *any* saved state (even factory)
starts streaming what the caster/FKP need — no operator config step. It sends one
Septentrio command over the CDC command channel:

```
setRTCMv3Output, USB1, RTCM1006+RTCM1033+RTCM1230
                     + RTCM1077+RTCM1087+RTCM1097+RTCM1107+RTCM1117+RTCM1127+RTCM1137   (MSM7, all GNSS)
                     + RTCM1019+RTCM1020+RTCM1042+RTCM1044+RTCM1046                      (eph: GPS/GLO/BDS/QZSS/GAL)
```

Design notes, all verified on hardware via the `mosaic` passthrough:

- **Current config only, never boot config.** Applied to the receiver's RAM, not
  saved with `exeCopyConfigFile` — the box stays the source of truth and the
  Mosaic's NVM (and its flash endurance) is left alone. The box re-applies each
  power-up.
- **Sent per-swept-interface until one acks.** `USB1` (itf2) accepts commands and
  acks with `$R:`; itf0 is silent both ways (returns nothing → `ESP_ERR_TIMEOUT`
  → retry on the next interface). The command targets `USB1` *by name*, so it
  applies regardless of which COM carried it.
- **Longer dwell right after a successful provision.** `setRTCMv3Output` restarts
  the port's output; the stream reappears ~2.5 s later. The interface we just
  acked on is almost certainly the data port, so we dwell 15 s (not 6 s) to catch
  it instead of hopping away and circling back a full sweep.
- **Best-effort, with fallback.** If provisioning fails, the box falls back to
  whatever the Mosaic was already configured to stream. It never bricks the link.

Verify with `rtcm`: after a cold boot the histogram shows MSM7 for every
constellation plus `1019/1020/1042/1044/1046` — with no manual Mosaic setup.

## WiFi via the onboard ESP32-C6 (ESP-Hosted)

The P4 has no radio; the onboard **C6** does WiFi, reached over **SDIO** with
`esp_hosted` + `esp_wifi_remote` (the C6 runs a version-matched ESP-Hosted slave
firmware). Provisioning is over the USB console — `wifiset <ssid> [pass]` saves to
NVS and reboots; on `GOT_IP` the caster auto-starts. (SoftAP/BLE field
provisioning is a `TODO`: SoftAP over ESP-Hosted is an upstream-broken area.)

**C6 reset is self-contained — no external tool needed.** The P4 resets the C6
via **GPIO15** (ESP-Hosted, active-low). The C6's **IO9 boot strap is not wired to
any P4 GPIO**, but the board holds it high with a **10K pull-up (R91 → WLAN_3.3V)**,
so a bare GPIO15 EN pulse always boots the C6 *application* (SDIO slave). A cold P4
boot therefore brings the C6 up on its own.

> **Product note — leave the C6_ISP header (J1) unpopulated in the field.** J1
> breaks out C6 EN (pin3) and IO9 (pin5). An M5 ESP32 Downloader left plugged in,
> even with its port idle, drags IO9 low via DTR/RTS (overriding the weak R91) and
> forces the C6 into download mode on every reset — the SDIO card enumerates but
> the ESP-Hosted transport never connects (`Not able to connect with slave`). This
> dev-rig artifact, not any firmware defect, was behind the earlier "C6 needs a
> downloader EN-reset" episodes. Unplug the downloader and GPIO15 self-reset works.

## Debugging

On-device REPL over the console (USB-Serial-JTAG, same USB-C port as
`idf.py monitor`). Type `help`; commands:

| cmd | what |
|-----|------|
| `stats` | byte count, CRC-valid frame count, CRC fails, ms since last good frame |
| `rtcm`  | monitor's message-type histogram — shows obs (`1005/1077/1087/1097`) + ephemeris (`1019/1020/1042/1046`) presence |
| `dump [n]` / `raw` | hexdump of the last CRC-valid frame / last raw bytes (spot NMEA decoys) |
| `usb`   | USB host installed? device attached? CDC open? attached VID/PID + per-itf topology |
| `mosaic <cmd>` | send a raw Septentrio command to the Mosaic + print the reply (e.g. `mosaic getRTCMv3Output`) — how the provisioning syntax was verified live |
| `caster` | start the Zig ntripcaster (listener + local source) manually |
| `csource` | caster's `/MOSAIC` source state (bytes/types via the tee) |
| `wifiset <ssid> [pass]` / `wifireset` | set / erase WiFi creds in NVS (reboots) |
| `upstreamset <host> <port> <mount> <pass>` / `upstream` / `upstreamreset` | set / show / erase cloud-upstream creds in NVS |
| `webadmin <user> <pass>` / `webadminreset` | set / erase the Basic-auth creds for the `/admin` web config (see below) |

The periodic 5s log line folds USB state (`usb[host= attach= open= VID:PID
stream=…]`) + rx counters into `idf.py monitor`, so the box is diagnosable from
any capture window without catching one-shot boot events.

**Admin web credentials — there is no default.** The `/admin` config page and
its `POST /admin/*` writes are gated by HTTP Basic auth, and **every write
returns `503` until you set a password** with `webadmin <user> <pass>` on the
console (stored in NVS, never hardcoded — deliberately *not* published here, so a
flashed box isn't shipped with a known credential). `webadminreset` disables the
writes again. The read-only status (`GET /` and `/api/status`) needs no auth.

`rtcm_monitor.c` validates **CRC-24Q**, so `valid_frames` means real RTCM3, not
stray `0xD3` bytes. It's a permanent diagnostic tap — keep it after the caster.

## Milestones

- **M0 — enumerate. ✅** Mosaic attaches (`152A:85C0`), VBUS gate driven, per-itf
  topology logged.
- **M1 — bytes flow. ✅** Sweep + CRC-latch itf2; CRC-valid multi-GNSS RTCM3.
- **M2 — caster. ✅** Zig `ntripcaster` embedded (lwip backend) fed from the sink
  tee; `/MOSAIC` source ingests live RTCM3.
- **M2.5 — turnkey. ✅** C6 WiFi self-reset on cold boot → STA join → caster
  auto-start → network NTRIP client pulls live RTCM3 end-to-end, no operator input.
- **M3-A — cloud upstream. ✅** Outbound NTRIP push of the base RTCM3 to the
  cloud caster (`/TAB5`), exp-backoff reconnect; `upstreamset` creds in NVS.
  Speaks **NTRIP v2 (HTTP POST + Basic auth)** by default and auto-falls back to
  the legacy **v1 SOURCE** line if the caster doesn't answer HTTP (`upstream`
  shows `streaming (v2)` / `(v1)`).
- **M3-eph — ephemeris + self-provisioning. ✅** The box configures the Mosaic's
  RTCM3 output itself on boot (MSM7 + 1006/1033/1230 + eph 1019/1020/1042/1044/
  1046), verified from a no-eph receiver back to full eph with no manual setup.
- **M3-B — UI. ✅** Tab5 MIPI-DSI status panel (720x1280 ST7123/ILI9881C
  auto-detect) with an LVGL status page — caster/rover count, RTCM rate + CRC +
  constellations, WiFi/IP, cloud upstream — refreshed 1 Hz. De-gated: a panel or
  UI fault can't stall the caster.
- **M3-C — power-aware panel. ✅** The panel LED string and the Mosaic's USB-A 5V
  share a supply, so a fixed-brightness backlight browned the receiver off the
  bus (no RTCM3) on a thin supply — a latent M3-B regression. `backlight.c` now
  holds a safe floor until RTCM3 streams, then climbs toward target only as the
  supply proves it can sustain it, learning a session ceiling on any real (stale)
  stream drop — auto-calibrating, no hard cap. Plus idle-off: the ST7123 touch
  (@0x55, 10 Hz activity poll) blanks the panel after 3 min untouched and wakes
  it on a tap; the RTCM3 stream keeps flowing at 0% backlight while blanked.
- **M3-D — GNSS view. ✅** A second read-only CDC interface (itf4 = USB2) parses
  the Mosaic's GGA + GSV (self-provisioned alongside RTCM3), never touching the
  caster path. `gnss_view.c` renders it: a skyplot (horizon + 30°/60° rings +
  N/E/S/W, a constellation-coloured dot per satellite) and a C/N0 bar strip with
  per-bar PRN labels. Dots/bars are absolute-positioned — a per-tick flex
  relayout of ~30 bars tripped the LVGL task watchdog.
- **M3-E — status web server. ✅** A **read-only** HTTP server (`web_server.c`,
  esp_http_server on `:8080`, the port already advertised over `_http._tcp`)
  serves `GET /api/status` (JSON) and `GET /` (a self-contained dashboard). Both
  are built from the same live accessors the LVGL panel uses
  (`wifi_sta_status` / `usb_cdc_source_status` / `upstream_status` /
  `rtcm_monitor_get` / `caster_source_stats`), so the server holds no state — the
  page computes RTCM rate from successive polls. De-gated like the panel: it
  starts on `GOT_IP` alongside the caster and a failure to start never stalls it.
  No config writes — it cannot touch the caster path. Verified on hardware:
  `http://rtk.local:8080/` after a turnkey boot.
- **M3-F — admin config (writes). ✅** A `/admin` page (and `POST /admin/*` API)
  to reconfigure the box from a browser: cloud-upstream creds (= `upstreamset`,
  no reboot), a Mosaic Septentrio-command passthrough (= the `mosaic` console
  cmd), WiFi creds, and reboot. All writes are guarded by **HTTP Basic auth**
  whose creds live in NVS (`webadmin` / `webadminreset` console cmds); until a
  password is set every write returns **503**, so a box on an open field LAN
  can't be reconfigured out of the box. Endpoints sit under `/admin/` so the
  browser reuses the cached Basic creds for the page's `fetch()` POSTs; the
  read-only `GET /` + `/api/status` stay open; passwords are never echoed in any
  GET. Reboot-bearing writes (WiFi, reboot) send their response first, then
  `esp_restart()` from a deferred task. Note: web WiFi config only helps while
  the box is already reachable — first-join provisioning stays console/BLE.

## Discovery (mDNS)

`net_mdns.c` advertises the box as **`rtk.local`** with `_ntrip._tcp` (caster) and
`_http._tcp` (status UI on `:8080`, served by `web_server.c` — see M3-E), so a
field rover / laptop finds it by name. It becomes reachable once the C6 netif is
up. Per-unit unique hostnames (`rtk-<serial>`) are a product TODO to avoid
`.local` collisions on a shared LAN.

## Build (on a machine with ESP-IDF 5.4+)

The firmware links the Zig **[ntripcaster](https://github.com/yasunorioi/ntripcaster)**,
which is **not vendored here** — clone it as a sibling at `~/ntripcaster` first
(the build reads `$HOME/ntripcaster`; a Zig toolchain is required):

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yasunorioi/ntripcaster ~/ntripcaster
idf.py set-target esp32p4
idf.py build flash monitor      # flash over the USB-C port (USB-Serial-JTAG)
```

The Zig caster is cross-compiled into `components/ntripcaster/` by the IDF build
(`zig build caster-lib -Dio-backend=lwip …`); its CMake rule re-runs when any
`~/ntripcaster/src/*.zig` changes.

## Field reconnect test (#3)

The reconnect state machines (WiFi STA, cloud upstream, Mosaic re-latch) are
verified on the bench with the `wifidrop` / `upstreamdrop` console hooks; the
same hooks reproduce the scenarios in the field, where the real stressors live
(Starlink IPv6 rotation, long-range WiFi under weather, generator/contactor EMI).

Open the console over the USB-C port (`idf.py monitor`, or any serial term at
115200) and confirm the baseline first:

```
wifi        # connected=1, has an IP
upstream    # connected=1, streaming, note the reconnects count
stats       # valid_frames rising, crc_fails=0
```

Then exercise each path and watch it recover:

```
upstreamdrop   # cloud SOURCE socket closed → backoff reconnect
               #   expect: "connected … /TAB5 — streaming", reconnects +1
wifidrop       # STA disassociated → auto-reconnect
               #   expect: "disconnected — reconnecting" → "got IP" (~seconds)
```

After either drop — and after any real outage — `stats` must keep advancing
(the RTCM3 core streams throughout) and a rover must be able to `GET /MOSAIC`
again (the caster listener survives the reconnect).

**Mount reclaim is now immediate (was ~30–45 s).** After a reboot or a WiFi
drop, the cloud caster still holds the box's previous `/TAB5` connection as a
half-open zombie. The caster now treats an **authenticated reconnect as a
takeover**: because a mount is one base by design, a new SOURCE/POST whose
password checks out evicts the stale connection as soon as it has been idle past
a short grace (`SOURCE_TAKEOVER_IDLE_MS`, 3 s in
[ntripcaster](https://github.com/yasunorioi/ntripcaster)) instead of waiting out
the old 30 s stale timer. Since a reboot/reconnect already exceeds that grace,
the box reclaims `/TAB5` on its first attempt — no more `Mount already in use`
backoff. (A *live* source streaming at 1 Hz keeps its idle under the grace, so
two bases misconfigured onto one mount still can't flap-evict each other.)

For the stressors that only the field exercises, leave the box deployed and
poll `upstream` / `wifi` / `stats` over hours — a climbing `reconnects` with the
stream still healthy is the link recovering as designed; a stalled `stats` with
a stuck backoff is the thing to capture.
